    <p>This is a blog about my learning journey, specifically linux, python and web development. I should also like to document my thoughts and observations about management and leadership theory and practices. Why? Because it's interesting. And because I can :)</p>
<p>I first became interested in linux and open source software in 2008 when I installed PCLinux OS on my laptop. What a revelation. It opened my eyes to a mighty interesting world previously unknown to me. The Cathedral and the Bazaar. Copyleft. Lots and lots of software. I was hooked. Eventually I wanted to be participate in that world, not just consume its fruits.</p>
<p>I'm a chemical engineer by training and in my day job, I am a project manager at a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant. One day, while sharing  my frustrations with a friend about the horrible enterprise software at work for managing HR workflows, ERP transactions, maintenance management, etc, I decided I could do a better job. All I had to do was learn to program.</p>
<p>Someone once said: A journey of a thousand miles begins with a first step. So here I am taking my baby steps. I have profited greatly from the vast learning material that others so generously shared on the internet. I hope this blog makes a small contribution to someone else's learning journey.</p>
